This project implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for handwritten digit
classification using the sklearn digits dataset. Feature scaling is applied
using StandardScaler. Multiple K values are tested to find optimal performance.
The model achieves ~98% accuracy. Results include accuracy plot, confusion
matrix, and predicted digit visualizations.
